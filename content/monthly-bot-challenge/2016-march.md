You could have made a bot that [tweets think pieces as a movie icon or TV show character](http://www.vogue.com/13403807/mulder-hot-take-the-x-files-twitter-bot/), a series of bots that [recreate scenes from a popular sitcom](http://algopop.tumblr.com/post/131697941088/allmybots-the-friends-botnet-re-creates) -- or one inspired by these bots:
