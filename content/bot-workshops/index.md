[Botmaking from the Ground Up](/bot-workshops/botmaking-from-the-ground-up) is a fun and informative [workshop](/bot-workshops/) on how to get started writing Twitter bots.

With [Bradley Momberger](https://twitter.com/air_hadoken)'s guidance, you will create three bots with the barest minimum of programming required.
