> National Botmaking Month. It's like [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015), which is itself like [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/), inasmuch as all three are creative challenges which take place during the month of November. All three are international, so Na is a bit of a misnomer, but InBoMaMo is even more of a mouthful.
