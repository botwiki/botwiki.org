[![Making Bots with Dexter](/content/tutorials/images/making-bots-dexter.png)](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish/status/664130256266264576){.float-right}

There is a variety of tools that make creating bots very easy. From [Cheap Bots Done Quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) (specifically for Twitter bots) and [Dexter](https://rundexter.com/), which is still in beta, but aims to make creating bots as easy as [dragging and dropping](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish/status/664130256266264576), to browser-based development environments, like [Cloud9](https://c9.io/). You can also find many [opensourced bots](/tag/opensource) that you can reuse and build on top of.

Botmaking has never been easier!

If you have any questions, try asking in our [community for botmakers and bot enthusiasts](https://botmakers.org/).

### [¶](#bot-hosting){.pilcrow} Bot hosting {#bot-hosting}

You have quite a few options when it comes to hosting your bots.

***Note:** See also [the Tools section](/resources/tools#botmaking).*

- [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/) -- a popular VPS (Virtual Private Server), starts at $5/month (it's also used to host this site; our [referral link](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=9e279abc3337) gets you $10 starter credit)
- [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) -- a [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), comes with a free plan
- [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) -- browser-based IDE (integrated development environment) that vastly simplifies the development process; offers a free plan that works well with OpenShift for hosting
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) -- similar to OpenShift, but your app needs to "sleep" for six hours each day (see details on the [pricing page](https://www.heroku.com/pricing)), useful tutorials include:
 - [Intermediate Cron Jobs with Heroku](http://blog.andyjiang.com/intermediate-cron-jobs-with-heroku/)
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) -- another VPS, starts at $10/mo
- [dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) -- web hosting and domain name registrar, their VPS starts at $15/month
- [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/d/11dB74uW9VLpgvy1Ax3eBZ8J7as0ZrGtx4BPw7RKK-JQXyAJHBx98pY-7/edit?usp=sharing) -- see [Bradley Momberger](https://twitter.com/air_hadoken)'s [blog](http://airhadoken.github.io/2015/06/29/twitter-lib-explained.html) for more details
- [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) -- "Host, run, and code Python in the cloud!" -- see also slides from the [Build A Bot](https://tpinecone.gitbooks.io/build-a-bot-workshop/content/index.html) workshop
- you can even use your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Twitterbot/)

Specifically for Twitter bots, you can try:
- [Cheap Bots, Done Quick!](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) -- see [tutorials](/tutorials/twitterbots/#cheap-bots-done-quick) and [examples](/tag/cheapbotsdonequick) of bots created with CBDQ
- [tilde.town](http://tilde.town/) (Twitter and IRC bots)

See also [Hosting Slack Integrations](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/hosting-slack-integrations-79f3d4b04dd6#.5b0vc2x46) on the [Slack API Developer Blog](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog).

**Note: ** [@beaugunderson](https://twitter.com/beaugunderson) is offering to let people host bots on his [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) account.

Common ways to manage multiple bots on the same network are:

- running each bot as a separate app/process with its own API keys
- running all of your bots in one app, using the same set of API keys
- or as a variation, you can create multiple apps, but still use the same API keys

For more general tutorials on hosting bots, see articles below. (Some [network specific tutorials](#network-specific-tutorials) include a step explaining how to host your bot.)
