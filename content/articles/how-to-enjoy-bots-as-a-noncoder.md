I created Botwiki with two audiences in mind: people who want to make bots, and people who just want to look at other people's bots.

Watching people people who don't necessarily consider themselves "coders" use this site and go from "What is this site for? What even *are* bots?" to "Hey, this is actually pretty cool!" has been interesting, and also motivating.

I'm putting this page together as a reference for folks who might feel a little bit intimidated by what they perceive as a lack of certain kind of knowledge or skills.

***Botwiki, and [bots](/bots/) are for everyone!***


## [¶](#browsing-botwiki){.pilcrow} Browsing Botwiki {#browsing-botwiki}

You can start on the [Bots](/bots/) page and work your way around the site by clicking on whatever looks interesting to you.

Botwiki is very easy to navigate thanks to curated lists of links that let you browse bots by categories, such as [bots that let you play games](/tag/bot+game), [bots that use emoji](/tag/bot+emoji), or [bots that post GIFs](/tag/bot+gif).

Check the top site navigation to go beyond browsing bots with [articles](/articles/), [events](/events/), or [learn more about Botwiki](/about/) and [related projects](/projects/).
