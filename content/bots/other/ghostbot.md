[Ghostbot](https://ghostbot.burnerapp.com) is a [Burner](http://www.burnerapp.com/) bot created by [Burner](https://twitter.com/burner), Voxable, and Peter Miriani.

> It’s simple.
>
> 1. Visit the Ghostbot web page and activate Ghostbot on your Burner number (or create a free new Burner number now if you don’t already have one). You’ll want to download the Burner app as well, to manage other settings on the number and to use it with the people you don’t want to ghost.
>
> 2. Select or add the contact(s) you want to ghost. 
>
> 3. Wait for a message. When Ghostbot sees incoming texts from a person who has been “ghosted,” it runs a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine to reply. After a variable delay, it replies to the message with one of many possible scripted responses: For example, “nope,” “I just have no time right now,” “sorry, I’m just completely overwhelmed with work,” or “sorry, just me and 🍕 tonight.” This continues until the conversation peters out and the texter gets the hint.
