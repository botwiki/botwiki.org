[@TheGIFingBot](https://twitter.com/TheGIFingBot) is an [open source](https://github.com/jeremylow/TheGIFingBot) Twitter bot created by [Jeremy Low](https://twitter.com/__jcbl__).

>Since GIFs on Twitter are converted into MP4 files, they’re not as easy to keep, download, organize, &c. Everyone loves GIFs is what I am saying. TheGIFingBot exists to return the MP4s to their true, GIF form and make GIFs shareable on Twitter again.
