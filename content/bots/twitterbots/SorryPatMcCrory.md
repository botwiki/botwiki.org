> Every time the [Governor of North Carolina](https://twitter.com/PatMcCroryNC) tweets, the [@SorryPatMcCrory](https://twitter.com/SorryPatMcCrory) bot appends the Tweet with some version of "Sorry!"
>
> Inspired by the [@apologytrump](https://twitter.com/apologytrump) Twitter account, the accumulation of "Sorry!" in this feed is a way to draw attention to many of the economic and political decisions and policies being made that are wreaking havoc on the people of North Carolina.
