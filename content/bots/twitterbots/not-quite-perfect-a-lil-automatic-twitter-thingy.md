[not-quite-perfect-a-lil-automatic-twitter-thingy](http://exponentialdecay.co.uk/blog/not-quite-perfect-a-lil-automatic-twitter-thingy) is an [open source](https://github.com/exponential-decay/binary-numbers) Twitter bot created by [Ross Spencer](https://twitter.com/beet_keeper).

> Using public domain color palettes made available by The National Library of New Zealand I create a new Twitter avatar each day for my @beet_keeper account.
>
> The images are visual representations of the binary value for the day's number within the month. Documented [here](http://exponentialdecay.co.uk/blog/not-quite-perfect-a-lil-automatic-twitter-thingy/), the project completed a 365 day run to allow me to make a year of 'gifs', also documented [here](http://exponentialdecay.co.uk/blog/2015-a-year-in-binary/).
