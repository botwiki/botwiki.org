[@adventvrecall](https://twitter.com/adventvrecall) is a Twitter-based game bot created by [@neauoire](https://twitter.com/neauoire) and [@noirmirroir](https://twitter.com/noirmirroir).

From the [official website](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/advent+v):

> Advent V, is a simple twitter game in the format of the Choose Your Own Adventure where the players tell Advent where to go in a choice of locations.

> The current state of the game works by sending tweets at the @adventvrecall account with a choice of direction that you wish for the bot to take in response to its message.

The game appears to be inactive at the moment.
