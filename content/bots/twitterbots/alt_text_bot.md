[@alt_text_bot](https://twitter.com/alt_text_bot) is an [open source](https://github.com/ckundo/alt-text-bot) Twitter bot that provides description of an image included in a tweet that mentions it. From the [author's description](https://github.com/ckundo/alt-text-bot/blob/master/README.md):

> Twitter is an important part of public discourse. As it becomes more and more image heavy, people who are blind are left out of the conversation. That's where Alt-Bot comes in. Alt-Bot fills the gaps in image content using an image recognition API to add text descriptions.

The bot uses the [CloudSight](http://cloudsightapi.com/) API for image recognition. Before using [@alt_text_bot](https://twitter.com/alt_text_bot), you need to sign up at [alttextbot.com](http://alttextbot.com) -- this is due to problems with spam in the past.

The bot was created by [Cameron Cundiff](https://twitter.com/ckundo).
