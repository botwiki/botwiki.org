[@sunnyday4pm](https://twitter.com/sunnyday4pm) is an [open source](https://github.com/fhoehl/sunnyday4pm) Twitter bot created by [@fhoehl](https://twitter.com/fhoehl) that generates images of ice cream.


It uses a genetic algorithm to evolve them. The number of likes an ice cream gets on Twitter is used as a score to generate the next one.

See [author's blog](http://fhoehl.com/2015/08/30/sunny-day-4pm.html) for more information.
