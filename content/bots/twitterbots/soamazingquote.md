[@soamazingquote](https://twitter.com/soamazingquote) is an [open source](https://github.com/lizadaly/soamazingquote) Twitter bot created by [Liza Daly](https://twitter.com/liza). 

> So Amazing Quote searches Twitter for inspirational-sounding terms like "leadership", "achievement", and, uh, "inspiration" and then re-attributes them to famous people. It generates an attractive Twitter card suitable for irritating pedants who will get angry at your obviously false unattributed quotations. As Aristole once said, "YOLO."
