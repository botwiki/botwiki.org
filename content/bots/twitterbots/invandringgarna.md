[@invandringgarna](http://twitter.com/invandringgarna) is an [open source](https://github.com/ArVID220u/invandringsbot) Twitter bot created by [ArVID220u](https://twitter.com/arvid220u).

When people post ignorant tweets about immigration, this bot replies with a rant about the moral responsibility we all have to welcome refugees.

It's in Swedish, but you can easily translate it into your language. The source code is [on Github](https://github.com/ArVID220u/invandringsbot). Simply clone it, change the trigger word (it should be a word that is often used in ignorant tweets about immigrants), and change the contents of the rant.
