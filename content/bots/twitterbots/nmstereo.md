[@nmstereo](https://twitter.com/nmstereo) was a Twitter bot that would accept a [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) URL to a song and play it on the stereo in the [NixonMcInnes](https://twitter.com/nixonmcinnes) office. This bot is apparently inactive, but the source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/nixmc/nmstereo-enterprise-edition/).
