So what exactly is a "bot"? Well, it really depends on [who you ask](/what-is-a-bot).


> An Internet bot, also known as web robot, WWW robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone.

In essence, an online bot is (usually) a simple program that does something a human would otherwise do, like post pictures on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) or [retweet](https://twitter.com/) Tweets that talk about cats.

You can pretty much think of bots as programs that turn sites like [damnyoubatman.com](http://damnyoubatman.com/) or [hungernames.com](http://hungernames.com/) into automated [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) or [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) accounts. 


Bots can be funny, useful, artistic -- but also annoying and spammy. This site -- and our [botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) community, are dedicated to the friendlier of the online bots.


Feel free to browse the bots below -- [by categories](#browse-bots-by-category) or [by the network](#browse-bots-by-network) on which they operate, check out the [tutorials](/tutorials/), [read bot-related articles](/articles/) or just use the search on top of this page, if you're looking for something specific.


You are also welcome to join [botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/), our friendly community of botmakers and bot enthusiasts of all skill levels, to share ideas, ask questions or just see what interesting projects everyone is working on.
